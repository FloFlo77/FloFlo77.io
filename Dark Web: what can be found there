As a cybersecurity newbie, I just heard about Deep Web and that it's a dangerous and hard-to-access place. But what can be so dangerous about it - personally I had no clue. So, I started searching for some clarity:

[Dark Web - Scratching the Surface and Identifying the Potential Risks](https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/security-awareness/curiosity-dark-web-dangerous-effects/)
[How to safely access the deep and dark webs](https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-how-to-how-can-i-access-the-deep-web.html)
[What is Dark Web? - Is it dangerous? How to access it](https://www.business-standard.com/about/what-is-dark-web)
[What, How, & When - Everything about Dark We](https://en.vpnwelt.com/dark-web/)

I am sure that for a lot of you, this topic can be prominent, but maybe some people are still unaware of it.

So, the biggest dangerous of the dark net are malware, viruses, scams, and becoming a target of government agencies, according to https://en.vpnwelt.com/.

No one prepared me for the last point, honestly..
